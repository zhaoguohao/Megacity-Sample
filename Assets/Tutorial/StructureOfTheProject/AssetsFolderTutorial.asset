        m_Untranslated: Structure of the Assets folder
      Text:
        m_Untranslated: "This section is an overview of the Assets folder and how
          all assets were stored in the project. Every folder is named as its type
          of Asset, (e.g. Audio folder, it only contains Clips and AudioMixer). \n\nThe
          Scenes folder contains all SubScenes that are used in the Megacity scene.
          This folder also contains scenes to evaluate, test, and performance purposes,
          but the <b>only</b> necessary elements to run the project are the Sub Scenes
          inside <b>Scenes/Megacity/ and Scenes/Megacity.scene</b>.\n\nAdditionally,
          the Scripts folder is sorted by functionality, for example, all authoring
          scripts that run during conversion are stored in the <b>Scripts/Authoring</b>
          folder within its respective Assembly (<b>Unity.Megacity.Authoring</b>).\n\nIn
          Megacity this pattern was used also for <b>Scripts/Editor</b> and <b>Scripts/Gameplay</b>.
          Consider this pattern for future projects to improve the domain reload
          efficiency. \n\nThere are some folders such as GlobalEntitiesDependencies
          or SceneDependencyCache which are automatically created by the Unity asset
          build pipeline when the Scene is loaded or within the build creation.\n"
